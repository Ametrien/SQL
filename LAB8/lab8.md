#### Ex.2

SQL Server views are only updatable under certain conditions. A view can be updated, deleted, inserted only if it has only one base table if the view is based on columns from one or more tables then insert, update and delete is not possible. My view doesn't fullfil this restrictions, because it is made of 2 tables.

UPDATE:

DELETE:

#### Ex.3

You cannot add data through a view if the view: includes group functions, includes a GROUP BY clause, includes the DISTINCT keyword, includes the pseudocolumn ROWNUM keyword, includes columns defined by expressions, does not include NOT NULL columns in the base tables.
 
 In my case the quieries were not suitable for this from the beginning.
