### Laboratory work №1 – SQL Server Installation

#### Theory

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system. In this laboratory work we are going to use Microsoft SQL Server 2014. The logical components of a SQL Server System are:
* Databases
* Tables
*	Database Diagrams
* Indexes
* Views
* Schemes
* Synonyms
* Stored Procedures
* Triggers
* Functions
* Data Types
* Rules
* Sequences

#### №1 - System installation
1.	First of all, we have to download an .exe file, which will allow us to install the program. By clicking on it twice, we will open a new window. 
2.	Here we will have to click on the “Installation” in order to start the process of installation.

3. Now we will have to enter the product key.
4. After entering the product key, we will be able to read license terms. In order to continue the installation process, we must agree with them.

5.	Then the page “Global rules” will be open, where the assistant will go through a verification process.
6.	The next step is going to be “Product Updates”. To make this step more efficient, it’s highly recommended to have access to the internet. That will allow us to download us the up-to-date program file.
7.	The page “Install Setup Files” is meant to show some information that is connected to the process of downloading and installation of the files.
8.	In the next window called “Install Rules” we will use System configuration checker. Here we will be able to view a detailed report on the installation rules.

9.	In this window called “Setup role” we will have to choose the first option.

10.	This window is called “Feature Selection”. Here we can do a lot of things: modify the address of the stored files, read short description of features and select the needed ones.

11.	In the window “Feature rules – SQL Server Setup” will be validated the configuration before installation.
12.	“Instance configuration” window is needed to specify the name of the instance.
13.	In “Server Configuration” window it’s necessary to attribute SQL Server services to the accounts of users.
14.	Then in “Database Engine Configuration” we select the type of authentication. 
15.	In the window, which is called “Analysis Server Configuration”, in our case everything has to remain implicit. 
16.	In “Reporting Service Configuration” we have to choose option “Reporting service”.
17.	Then we specify at least one administrator in “Distributed Relay Controller”.
18.	In “Distributed Relay Client” we shouldn’t change anything, so we go to the next step.
19.	The “Ready to install” window tells us that the system is ready to be installed.
20.	In the “Installation Progress” we can watch the installation process and the current state of installation.
21.	The installation process is successfully done when we see the “Complete” window.
